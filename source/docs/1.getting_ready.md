# 1. Getting Ready

## 1. SpiderPi Instruction

### 1.1 Introduction

SpiderPi intelligent vision hexapod robot is powered by Raspberry Pi 5. The image processing library is OpenCV and the programming language is Python. Equipped with a 2-DOF high-definition camera, SpiderPi can perform facial recognition, color recognition, tag recognition, color tracking, line following, etc. With SpiderPi, you will learn robot machine vision, OpenCV and robot knowledge.

### 1.3 Usage Precautions

(1) Please pay attention to the following points when using and storing this product:

(2) This product contains conductive components. Avoid contact with metal objects when powered on.

(3) After the robot is powered on, do not forcibly move the servo, as this may cause damage.

(4) If the robot runs for an extended period, the servos may become hot. Allow the robot to "rest" and wait for the servos to cool before resuming operation.

(5) Keep your face, glasses, and other body parts away from the robot while it is operating. Do not place fingers within the joint movement range to prevent injury. Also, be cautious of falls from high edges.

(6) The robot's servos are precision components and consumable parts. They may need replacement after long-term or intensive use.

(7) If the product will not be used for an extended period, fully charge the battery, remove it, and store it in a cool, dry place.

## 2. Charging and Power-On Status Description

**Lithium batteries must be disconnected during transportation. Therefore, users should first connect the battery connector cable upon receiving the robot, then charge it. Only after the charging process is complete can the robot be powered on for the first time.**

### 2.1 Charging

:::{Note}
Please check whether the connector cable is properly connected before charging. Connect the red wire to red one and the black wire to black before charging.
:::

(1) please connect the red wire to red one and the black wire to black before charging.

### 2.2 Turn on SpiderPi

(1) Lift the legs of SpiderPi, place its bottom flat on the tabletop.

(2) Switch on Raspberry Pi expansion board on the back. The LED1 and LED2 of the Raspberry Pi will be on.

The Raspberry Pi is a small minicomputer. It usually takes about 1 minute to boot up from the time it is Powered ON, which is normal and expected.

(3) Wait for about 30 seconds, the buzzer will send a "beep" sound. The robot will be in its initial standing posture. LED1 on the expansion board at the back of the robot will remain on, while LED2 blinks once every second, indicating that the device has started up successfully.

(4) Raspberry Pi will be in a AP hotspot mode and launch a Wi-Fi hotspot with a network named with the first letters "HW".

### 2.3 Check Power Level

The SpiderPi's tail is equipped with a voltage display module, which allows real-time monitoring of the robot's current battery level, as shown below:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1/2.1/image8.png" style="width:700px" />

The working voltage range of SpiderPi is 9V to12.6V. When the battery is fully charged, the voltage display module will show "12.6". Please recharge SpiderPi in time when the current voltage is less than 10V.
