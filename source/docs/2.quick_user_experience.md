## 2.1 APP Installation and Connection 

The following instructions use TurboPi as an example and apply to other Hiwonder Raspberry Pi series products as well.
In this section, you will learn how to use APP "**WonderPi**" to control TurboPi. The installation method is as follows.

:::{Note}

① Make sure all APP permissions are turned on in settings, otherwise APP functions will be limited!

② Turn on Location and WiFi before operation.

:::

### 2.1.1 Installation

**[APP Installation Pack (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Wonder.Pi)**

**[APP Installation Pack (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/wonderpi/id1477946178)**

:::{Note}
- Please turn TurboPi on before connecting. 

- Make sure all APP permissions are turned on in settings, otherwise APP functions will be limited!

- Turn on Location and WiFi before operation.

:::

### 2.1.2 APP Connection

(1) Start robot. (The switch is on Raspberry Pi expansion board). For detailed instruction, please refer to the file in "**[Getting Ready\1.3 Charging and Power-On Status Explanation](https://docs.hiwonder.com/projects/SpiderPi/en/latest/docs/1.getting_ready.html#charging-and-power-on-status-description)**".

(2) After TurboPi boots up successfully, it enters AP direct connection mode, and generates a WiFi starting with **"HW"**. Join this WiFi, and then you can experience robot games

* **Introduction to Connection Mode**

There are two connection modes, namely direct connection mode and LAN mode. APP functions are the same under these two modes.

(1) **AP direct connection mode:** RaspberryPi generates a WiFi which can be connected by phones. But this WiFi has no internet access. 

(2) **STA LAN mode:** Raspberry Pi actively connects to specific WiFi. In this mode, you can access internet.

* **Direct Connection Mode (MUST-READ)** 

:::{Note}
After TurboPi boots up successfully, it enters AP direct connection mode, and generates a WiFi starting with **"HW"**.
:::

(1) Open"**WonderPi**". Select **"Standard ->TurboPi"** in sequence.

<img src="../_static/media/2/1.1/image3.jpg"   />

(2) Tap **"+"** in bottom right corner, and then select **Direct Connection Mode**.

<img src="../_static/media/2/1.1/image4.jpeg"   />

(3) Tap **"Go to connect device hotspot"**. Join WiFi starting with "**HW**". The password is **"hiwonder"**.

<img src="../_static/media/2/1.1/image5.jpeg"   />

<img src="../_static/media/2/1.1/image6.jpeg"  style="width:350px" class="common_img"  />

(4) Return back to APP after connection.

<img src="../_static/media/2/1.1/image7.jpeg" style="width:350px" class="common_img"  />

:::{Note}
 For iOS user, please don't return to APP until WiFi icon appears on status bar, otherwise robot cannot be searched. If robot cannot be searched by APP, tap <img src="../_static/media/2/1.1/image8.png" style="width:45px" /> to refresh.
:::

(5) APP automatically connects to robot. When robot icon below occurs, connection completes. 

<img src="../_static/media/2/1.1/image9.jpeg"   />

:::{Note}
if you are informed of "**No Internet. Whether to keep connection**", just select "**keep connected**".
:::

(6) Tap robot icon to enter mode selection interface.

<img src="../_static/media/2/1.1/image10.jpg"   />

For detailed introduction to robot games, please refer to the file in "**[2.2 APP Control](#anchor_2)**".

**1.2.3  LAN Connection Mode**

(1) Disconnect the WiFi generated by TurboPi. Connect your phone to a WiFi. Take **"Hiwonder"** as example.

<img src="../_static/media/2/1.1/image11.jpeg" style="width:350px" class="common_img"  />

(2) After connection, open **"WonderPi"**. Select **"Standard ->TurboPi"** in sequence.

<img src="../_static/media/2/1.1/image12.jpg"   />

(3) Tap **"+"** in bottom right corner, and then select LAN Mode.

<img src="../_static/media/2/1.1/image13.jpeg"   />

(4) Input the password of the WiFi your phone joins. Ensure the password you input is correct, otherwise APP fails to connect to robot. Tap **"OK"**.

<img src="../_static/media/2/1.1/image14.jpeg"   />

(5) Tap "**Go to connect device hotspot**".

<img src="../_static/media/2/1.1/image15.jpeg"   />

(6) Join the WiFi starting with **"HW".** The password is **"hiwonder"**. After connection, return back to APP.

* **Color Recognition** 

This game can recognize red, green, and blue. SpiderPi will nod when it detects red and shake its head when it detects blue or green.

:::{Note}
* Please start this game under a well-lit environment, but try to keep it from direct light.
* When recognizing, please do not have the same or similar colored object within the detected range to avoid interference.
*  If the recognition effect is not good enough, please refer to  [2.3 Adjust Color Threshold](#anchor_2_3).

## 2.3 Adjust Color Threshold

Different light source will have different influence on the colors, which will result in recognition discrepancy. To tackle this problem, you can adjust color threshold via "**WonderPi**" APP.

### 2.3.1 Preparation

Start TurboPi. Open "**WonderPi**" APP, and connect it to TurboPi. For how to connect robot to APP, operate referring to "**[2.1 APP Installation and Connection](#anchor_2_3)**".

### 2.3.2 Interface Layout

Tap  in upper right corner to enter color threshold adjustment interface.

### 2.3.3 Adjust Color Threshold

(1) Select color to be adjusted. Take red as example.

<img src="../_static/media/2/3.1/image19.png"  />

(2) Put red object within camera recognition zone. Set L_min, a_min and b_min to 0, and L_max, a_max and b_max to 255.

<img src="../_static/media/2/3.1/image20.png"  />

(3) Tap "Instruction" icon to check how to adjust color threshold.

<img src="../_static/media/2/3.1/image21.png"  />

<img src="../_static/media/2/3.1/image22.png"  />

:::{Note}
if you need to close Instruction window, select "**OK**".
:::

(4) Red approaches "**+a**" zone, so you need to adjust A component.

<img src="../_static/media/2/3.1/image23.png" style="width:300px" class="common_img"  />

(5) Keep "**a_max**" value the same, and then increase "**a_min**" value till red object turns white and other area is black.

<img src="../_static/media/2/3.1/image24.png"  />

(6) Adjust "**L**" and "**B**" values. If it belongs to light red, increase L_min. Otherwise, decrease L_max. If it belongs to warm tone, increase B_min. Otherwise, decrease B_max.

<img src="../_static/media/2/3.1/image25.png"  />

(7) Remember to save the value after adjustment.
